This repository contains all the code I worked on during the **NLP and Data Applications Project**. I built various applications using **BERT** and **LangChain**, and along the way, I learned how to leverage large language models and integrate them into real-world tasks like question-answering, entity extraction, and text generation- text to text and emoji to text and vice-versa.

# NLP and Data Applications using BERT & LangChain

## Project Overview

### 1. **LangChain Introduction**
This section demonstrates how to use the LangChain framework with OpenAI to perform tasks like:
- Language model integration
- Simple queries using ChatGPT
- Text generation and entity extraction
- Prompt customization for specialized responses

### 2. **App: CSV File Question Answering (app_csv_qa.py)**
An interactive web app built using **Streamlit**. Users can upload a CSV file and ask questions about the data. The app uses a language model to respond to user queries based on the contents of the file.

### 3. **BERT Introduction (BERT_intro.ipynb)**
A detailed introduction to using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for NLP tasks:
- Understanding tokenization
- Extracting word embeddings
- Exploring basic model usage

### 4. **BERT Tokenizer & Model Introduction (BERT_tokenizer_model_intro.ipynb)**
This notebook dives into tokenization and model outputs:
- Tokenizing text inputs
- Creating embeddings for specific words
- Comparing semantic similarities between texts

### 5. **BERT Example (example_bert_nsp.ipynb)**
This notebook uses BERT for specific tasks such as:
- Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
- Semantic similarity between sentences

**Learning Experience:**  
This repo has all the code I worked on during the **NLP and Data Applications Project**. I created various applications using **BERT**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**. Through this project, I learned how to use **language models**, build **interactive apps**, and handle **NLP tasks** such as tokenization, text generation, and question-answering with CSV data.
